# <p align="center">BINARY TREES</p>

Brief Explanation:
----------------------------------

A binary tree is a data structure in which each node can have at most two children, typically referred to as the "left" and "right" children. The top node of the tree is called the "root," and it's the starting point for navigating the tree. Nodes in a binary tree are organized in a hierarchical manner, where each node can have zero, one, or two child nodes. <be>

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science and programming to efficiently store and manipulate hierarchical data, such as in search algorithms, expression parsing, and data organization. They provide a way to represent hierarchical relationships in a structured manner.

Data structures
-----------------------------------

The following data structures and types for binary trees are used and are included in the header file.
**Basic Binary Tree**

	/**
	 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
	 *
	 * @n: Integer stored in the node
	 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
	 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
	 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
	 */
	struct binary_tree_s
	{
		int n;
		struct binary_tree_s *parent;
		struct binary_tree_s *left;
		struct binary_tree_s *right;
	};
	
	typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;

**Binary Search Tree**

	typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;

**AVL Tree**

	typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;

**Max Binary Heap**

	typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;

**Note:** From files 0-* to 23-* simple binary trees are the ones dealt with. They are not BSTs, thus they donâ€™t follow any kind of rule.
